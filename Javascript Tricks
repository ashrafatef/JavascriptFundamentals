Question :  what will the following code output ?
(function(){
  var a = b = 3;
})();
console.log("a defined? " + (typeof a !== 'undefined'));
console.log("b defined? " + (typeof b !== 'undefined'));

Answer  : 

a defined? false
b defined? true

Why ? in fact this code in IIFE equal to this : 
b = 3 ;
var a  = b ;
so b belongs to global object but a belongs to IFFE scope so it's undefined outside function's scope
